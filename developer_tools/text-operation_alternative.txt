Alternative of text-operations.py is to manually create the database entries,
This can be VERY useful.

1. You add your sql and values into the .sql file in /src
2. Adding new tables is also pretty easy, you just create your enum implement it, and add it into .sql
3. insterting via .sql is also how you can add values.

Your enum value should folow the IDS inside the database, so if your enum value is 3 then that enum value text should be in id 3 in the database.

If you follow these rules it's easy to create safely create new values or edit texts.
