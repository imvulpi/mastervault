This is a directory where all translations are put into.


1. Adding a language:
Create your own directory for language that interests you

Please name the directory (ISO 3 letter language code)_(name of that language)
ex. pol_polish

the 2nd (name of that language can be in that language or english up to your liking)
ex. pol_polski
ex. pol_polish
ex. pol_polish_polski
ex. pol_polski_polish

Dont make the names too big, make sure the 3 letter code is first.

2. Translation:

Copy directory of a version that you want to translate from inside template directory
Translate .sql files according to the tutorial below:

Now Translating
INFO: don't translate texts inside a block CREATE TABLE, you should translate texts inside lines with INSERT INTO ...

example:
lets take this text:
 INSERT INTO other_translations VALUES(0,'username','Too short');
after translation:
 INSERT INTO other_translations VALUES(0,'nazwa uzytkownika','za mala');

where to not translate:

DONT translate anything inside blocks like that below \/
These are used by the program :D

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS "other_translations" (
	"id"	INTEGER,
	"setting"	TEXT,
	"error"	TEXT,
	PRIMARY KEY("id")
);

Advantages of this method:

1. For developers - no need to develop and maintain translate.py tool
2. For translators - Easy way to see what was translated and what not.
3. For translators - Allows translation from other languages too
4. Easy way to check the texts, turn them into a sqlite database.
